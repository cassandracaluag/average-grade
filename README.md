### Requirements:
Scenario: You have 5 graded tests (45, 82, 17, 69, 38) and you need the class average in letter grade.

Objective: Find the average of those 5 graded tests, then based on the average, return the letter grade of that average using the following criteria:
 

A = >91%
B = 81-90%
C = 71-80%
D = 60-70%
F = <60%


The catch: Use a “switch” statement to check which letter grade to return.

Result: Have a console.log() send a message that says “The grade letter average is:” + average.

Extra challenge: Use a prompt() to receive the average grades of user inputted grades instead.
